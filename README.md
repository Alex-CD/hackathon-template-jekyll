# Hackathon Jekyll Template

[Check out the demo site](https://alex-cd.github.io/hackathon-template-jekyll/)


Forked from [the Royal Hackaway website](https://github.com/royalhackaway/royalhackaway.github.io).

### What it is

A starting point for hackathon organisers to build websites for their events.
Plop in some event files, and this jekyll site will do the rest.

Forked from the [Royal Hackaway](https://github.com/royalhackaway/royalhackaway.github.io) website, which I rebuilt for 2018-19 hackathon season.
